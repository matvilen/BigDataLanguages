It is no secret that our planet suffer from huge emissions of recycled
fuel. Therefore, some people believe that high prices on the fuel can
help to rectify the situation. In my opinion, this solution is not only
 useless, but also might be harmful for human being.
First of all, increasing the cost of the fuel will cause various social
problems, such as losses for small businesses, refusal to travel for the
poor, stopping the supply of goods to remote regions. And as a result,
even greater stratification between people. Actually, if we can influence
on the price, it is better to downgrade cost of hybrid cars. This way,
people will have more abilities to buy them and take care of the environment.
